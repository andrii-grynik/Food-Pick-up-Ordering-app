LHL Node Skeleton
=========

## Project Setup

The following steps are only for _one_ of the group members to perform.

1. Create your own copy of this repo using the `Use This Template` button, ideally using the name of your project. The repo should be marked Public
2. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub, you should be automatically redirected
3. Clone your copy of the repo to your dev machine
4. Add your team members as collaborators to the project so that they can push to this repo
5. Let your team members know the repo URL so that they use the same repo (they should _not_ create a copy/fork of this repo since that will add additional workflow complexity to the project)


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

# Project description

Following project is a Food Pick-up Ordering app, which will have following functionality:
"A food ordering experience for a single restaurant. Hungry clients of this fictitious restaurant can visit its website, select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. They will receive a notification when their order is ready.

The restaurant and client both need to be notified since this app serves as an intermediary.

When an order is placed the restaurant receives the order via SMS. The restaurant sends an sms with order and estimated time it will take to fulfill the order to customer.

We have used Twilio(https://www.twilio.com/) to implement SMS communication."

We emplemented dynamic style to webside with a SQL database for menu Items. We also added social media links for people to see reviews and follow their favority restaurant and possiblty explore their circle of friends with people who share same food taste. There is also a link on our website to this repository.

This repository includes a large skeleton for various implementations. We mainly utilized db, public, styles, and views folders, server.js is the main file we used on the root.
